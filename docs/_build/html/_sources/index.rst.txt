PredixPy
========

The Predix Python SDK has been lovingly crafted to help Python developers have
quick success writing applications using Predix Services.

Installation
------------

Install it from PyPI::

   pip install predix

If that isn't working for you, we highly recommend `The Hitchiker's Guide to
Properly Installing Python`_ to learn about installing ``python``, ``pip``, and
``virtualenv`` for your environment.  For industrial environments, you may also
need to learn how to set your proxies.
